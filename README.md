# clj-keyczar

A simple clojure encryption and signing library, with safe, sensible defaults for the
common uses, and support for key rotation and versioning (which are too often overlooked!)

It is a wrapper for the wonderful Keyczar library. We exposed the basic common functionality
with a simpler API:

1. encrypt and decrypt data
2. sign and verify messages
3. manage keysets: add, demote and revoke keys

The library can interoperate well with Keyczar classes. It's easy to keep using the simple
clj-keyczar API, but reach down into the Keyczar java API when needed.

## Usage

Add to your project.clj:

```clojure
    :dependencies [[circleci/clj-keyczar "0.1.0"]]
```

# crypt/decrypt

Create a new crypting keyset, add a key to it, encrypt and decrypt data:

```clojure
(let [keyset (-> (keyset/create :crypt)
                 (keyset/addkey))
      original "foo"
      ciphertext (crypt/encrypt keyset original)
      decrypted (crypt/decrypt keyset ciphertext)]
  (assert (= original decrypted)))
```

# sign/verify

Create a new signing keyset, add a key to it, sign and verify messages:

```clojure
(let [keyset (-> (keyset/create :sign)
                 (keyset/addkey))
      original "foo"
      signature (sign/sign keyset original)]
  (assert (sign/verify keyset original signature)))
```

# keyset operations

The support for key versioning and rotation is really what makes Keyczar awesome, and it's
frankly better documented better in
[the Keyczar documentation](https://code.google.com/p/keyczar/). In a nutshell, this wrapper
provides an API in clj-keyczar.keyset, for:

* creating new keysets, of purpose :crypt or :sign.
* adding a key to a keyset. The newly added key will be primary and active.
* demoting a key from a keyset.
* revoking a key from a keyset.

This API treats keysets as immutable; functions return brand-new keysets with the
requested changes applied. You will almost certainly need a separate mechanism for persisting
keysets. On the plus side, they're just trivially serializable maps. (For what it's worth,
we use the same system for storing keysets that we use to e.g. propagate database credentals
through our system.)

# work with file-based keysets

If you prefer, you can use the command-line
[KeyczarTool](https://code.google.com/p/keyczar/wiki/KeyczarTool) to manage file-based
keysets. Functions in the clj-keyczar.crypt and clj-keyczar.sign namespaces will happily
accept a directory path (a string) instead of a keyset map, and otherwise work the same:

```clojure
(let [keyset-path "/tmp/test-keyset"
      original "foo"
      ciphertext (crypt/encrypt keyset-path original)
      decrypted (crypt/decrypt keyset ciphertext)]
  (assert (= original decrypted)))
```

## Some crypto details

Though the keyczar library has a few bells and whistles, it provides great defaults -- so
great, in fact, that they're all this wrapper currently supports. Those defaults are:

* for :crypt keysets: 128-bit AES keys
* for :sign keysets: 256-bit HMAC keys

Other stuff currently not supported:

* asymmetric encryption
* internally encrypted keysets
* keyset operations on file-based keysets (just use KeyczarTool)
* pretty much anything that's not on the straight and narrow path of default keyczar behavior :P

Feel free to open issues or submit PRs to improve the library :)
